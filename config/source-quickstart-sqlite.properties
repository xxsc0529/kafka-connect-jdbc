# A simple example that copies all tables from a SQLite database. The first few settings are
# required for all connectors: a name, the connector class to run, and the maximum number of
# tasks to create:
name=test-source-sqlite-oceanbase-autoincrement
connector.class=io.confluent.connect.oceanbase.OceanBaseSourceConnector
tasks.max=1
# The remaining configs are specific to the JDBC source connector. In this example, we connect to a
# SQLite database stored in the file test.db, use and auto-incrementing column called 'id' to
# detect new rows as they are added, and output to topics prefixed with 'test-sqlite-oceanbase-', e.g.
# a table called 'users' will be written to the topic 'test-sqlite-oceanbase-users'.
connection.user=username
connection.password=password
connection.url=jdbc:oceanbase://ip:host/database
mode=incrementing
incrementing.column.name=id
topic.prefix=test-sqlite-oceanbase-

# Define when identifiers should be quoted in DDL and DML statements.
# The default is 'always' to maintain backward compatibility with prior versions.
# Set this to 'never' to avoid quoting fully-qualified or simple table and column names.
#quote.sql.identifiers=always
